# T300 - Functional Programming: Final Assessment

This assessment instrument contains the final activity for the curricular component **T300 - Functional Programming**.

## Objective

Develop a **personal financial management REST API** using **Elixir** and the **Phoenix Framework**. The goal is to create an application capable of registering a person's income and expenses.

## Features

The application must provide the following features:

- **Income registration**
- **Expense registration**
- **Listing of financial transactions**
- **Association of tags to transactions**
- **User registration and authentication**

## Architecture

- The **frontend** was developed using **Next.js**.
- The **backend** uses **Elixir** with the **Phoenix framework**.
- The frontend communicates with the backend REST API to perform all operations such as registration, listing, and authentication.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main folders:

- `back`: contains the backend code in Elixir/Phoenix
- `front`: contains the frontend code in Next.js

- The **backend** is responsible for all business logic, data persistence, and user authentication.
- The **frontend** provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system, allowing users to manage their personal finances.
